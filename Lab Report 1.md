**2) Remotely Connecting**
  To connect to a server remotely, we need to use our CSE 15L course-specific account. Open the terminal of vscode, and enter command "ssh <username>@ieng6.ucsd.edu",    where <username> is the place that you replace your CSE 15L account username with it. After that, there will be a message saying "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?". Type "yes", and enter the password of your CSE 15L account. After these procedures, you should be connected to a remote server:
